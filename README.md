# Solana's Wormhole Hackahthon &middot; $250k of prizes + seed funding

* Hackathon dates: October 28th through November 14
* Type: Online and global

## Introduction
Solana is the fastest, low-fee, censorship-resistant blockchain built to enable high-growth applications to scale to masses. Wormhole is the first trustless, bidirectional bridge that connects Ethereum with Solana. Wormhole allows new and existing crypto projects, businesses, and communities to move tokenized assets seamlessly across blockchains to benefit from Solana’s high speed (50,000 transactions per second) and low cost (less than $0.0001 per transaction). 

As long as you have an internet connection, you're invited to join our first global hackathon! Combining Wormhole with Solana’s core features gives hackers an open design space to create entirely new applications that could bring in the next wave of crypto users. While we encourage participants to build with Wormhole, hackers can build any application or tool they believe will have an impact on the ecosystem. The only requirement is that teams must incorporate Solana into their project in some way.  Take a look at our list of ideas for inspiration link
